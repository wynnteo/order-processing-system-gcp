# Integrating Vue.js with Serverless Order Processing System

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll extend our system by integrating a client user interface (UI) using Vue.js. Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. We will focus on:

- Setting up a Vue.js project.
- Building components for order creation and displaying order status.
- Integrating Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for real-time push notifications.
